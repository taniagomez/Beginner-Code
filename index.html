    3.What are the three most challenging things you've encountered this semester while taking this course?
</h2>
    <p>

        The most challenging things I've encountered have been memorizing elements and attributes as we continue to learn more. I've also found coding is a lot like math, sometimes you mess up and it ruins everything. Finding where you messed up can be frustrating but it's also what keeps things interesting. The validator has also been an imense helper. For some reason, I've also had trouble with the files provided from the book. I've done fine without them but it wuld be nice to have them.
